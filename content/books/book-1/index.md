The manzanitas like sunny ground. On warm ridges and sandy flats at the foot of sun-beaten ca√±on cliffs, some of the tallest specimens have well-defined trunks six inches of a foot or more thick, and stand apart in orchard-like growths which in bloomtime are among the finest garden sights in the Park.
